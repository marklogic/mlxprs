### Submit Optic Queries

To run an Optic query (either DSL or serialized):

1. Type a valid query in the editor.
2. Open the VS Code command palette.
3. Select one of the `MarkLogic: Submit Optic Query - <Response Format>` commands, depending on the desired response format.

Query results will apper in the `MLXPRS: RESULTS` tab in the bottom panel, or open in a new editor tab - depending on the value of the `Marklogic: Results In Editor Tab` setting.
