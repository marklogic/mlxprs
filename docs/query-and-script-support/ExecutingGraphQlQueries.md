### Submit GraphQL Queries

To run a GraphQL query:

1. Type a valid query in the editor.
2. Open the VS Code command palette.
3. Select the `MarkLogic: Submit GraphQL Query` command.

Query results will apper in the `MLXPRS: RESULTS` tab in the bottom panel, or open in a new editor tab - depending on the value of the `Marklogic: Results In Editor Tab` setting.

For more information on sending GraphQL request to MarkLogic, please refer to [GET /v1/rows/graphql](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/GET/v1/rows/graphql) and [Introduction to GraphQL with MarkLogic](https://www.marklogic.com/blog/introduction-to-graphql-with-marklogic/).
