This extension provides an easy method for inspecting the current state of module documents in the database.
You must configure the extension to use your target modules database. See [Installation & Configuration](installationAndConfiguration.md) for information on configuring the extension.

### To view a module from the configured modules database:

1. Open the VS Code command palette.
2. Select `MarkLogic: Show Module` from the list.
3. Choose the module you'd like to view from the resulting list. The list searches and filters as you type.

The module will appear read-only in a new text buffer.
