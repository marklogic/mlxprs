## Credit

Aside from excellent development and extension support from Visual Studio Code,

- Portions of Josh Johnson's [vscode-xml](https://github.com/DotJoshJohnson/vscode-xml) project are re-used
for XML formatting. The MIT license and source code are kept in the `client/xmlFormatting` folder of this project.
- Christy Haragan's [marklogic-node-typescript-definitions](https://github.com/christyharagan/ml-typescript-definitions)
made this project possible.
- Paxton Hare's [marklogic-sublime](https://github.com/paxtonhare/MarkLogic-Sublime)
`xquery-ml.tmLanguage` code is used for XQuery-ML syntax and snippets, and the MarkLogic Sublime project inspired this one.
